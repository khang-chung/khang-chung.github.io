**Description**
<br>
This simple arcade game mimicks a one-player version of pong. I used the <a href = "https://processing.org/">Processing</a> integrated development environment(IDE) to develop this game. No libraries were used during this project, allowing for me to embed it into a website.
<br>
The boundaries on the side as well as the ball change color upon contact.

Each time the ball hits the paddle, the player earns a point. Every 5 points, the player gets a bonus point, but the speed of the ball increases as well.

The high score is saved per session, meaning if the game is closed out, the high score will be reset back to 0 when a new one is opened.
